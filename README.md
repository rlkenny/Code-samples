# Code-samples
Samples of R code I have written or collaborated on

The following are code samples from a variety of projects over the last five years:

1.Conservation International 

File names: 
CI_VSR_food_security_analysis.Rmd
CI_VSR_yield_analysis.Rmd

This code was a UCSB graduate research team effort which I led as project manager, 
working with our client Conservation International. Code was written by Rachel Kenny 
and Austin Richards. The aim of this analysis was to investigate tradeoffs between
crop yield, environmental concerns, and food security needs in Rwanda.


2. Irvine Ranch Conservancy

File name: 
IRC_tecate_survival.Rmd

This code was written while I served as Project Manager of the monitoring & research 
team at Irvine Ranch Conservancy, a non-profit dedicated to habitat restoration in 
Southern California. The goal was to analyse the success of endangered Tecate Cypress 
restoration efforts, and the contribution of various environmental and abiotic 
variables to that success.


3. University of California, Santa Barbara
Bren School of Environmental Science and Management

File name: 
UCSB_Shiny_app_biodiversity_and_pop_growth

The code for this Shiny App was written for the final project for my Advanced Data 
Analysis class, taken at UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science with Dr. Allison Horst.
I had the idea to compare listed species by taxa (data from IUCN) with population growth 
rates (data from United Nations) for each country. I created various interactive data 
visualizations showing where these species were located and which may be most threatened 
by the indirect consequences of population expansion.
